AWS Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)

1) It is a infrastructure as a service.
2) It mainly consists in the Capability of:
	1) Renting virtual Machines(EC2)
	2) Storing data on virtual Machines(EBS)
	3) Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	4) Scaling the services using an auto scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing and Configuration options:
	Operating Systems: Linux, Windows or Mac OS
	How much compute power and cores(CPU)
	How much Random Access Memory (RAM)
	How much storage Space: 
		Newtork attached (EBS & EFS)
		hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
	Network card: Speed of the card, Public IP Address
	Firewall Rules: Security Group
	Bootstrap Script(configure at first launch): EC2 user data

EC2 User Data:
	It is possible to bootstrap our instances usinf an EC2 User data script.
	Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
	This script is only run once at the first start
	EC2 used data is used to automate boot tasks sucha as:
		-> Installing updates
		-> Installing Softwares
		-> Downloading common files from the internet
		-> Anything you can think of
	The EC2 User data script runs with the root user(sudo at start)

EC2 instance Type:
	Example:
	
	t2.micro, t2.xlarge, c5d.4xlarge...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Public IP of EC2 change when stopped but its private IP remains the same.

EC2 Instance Types:
	1) General Puspose
	2) Compute Optimized
	3) Memory Optimized
	4) Accelerated Computing
	5) Storage Optimized
	6) Instance feature
	7) Measuring Instance Performance

m5.2xlarge -> m = Instance Class
		  5 = generation (AWS imporves them over time)
		  2xlarge = size within the instance class 

Security Group:
	All inbound traffic is blocked by default
	All outbound traffic is authorized by default 

Attach IAM Roles to AWS EC2:
	-> doing AWS configure in AWS Instance Connect and setting Access key is bad idea as it can be accessed by any one.
	-> Alternative of this is to attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance and get only that data which is public no the personal datas.
	

	
QUIZ:

Which EC2 Purchasing Option can provide the biggest discount, but is not suitable for critical jobs or databases?
-> Spot Instances

1 year or 3 years terms are available for EC2 Reserved Instances.

Compute Optimized :
	Compute Optimized EC2 instances are great for compute-intensive workloads requiring high performance processors, such as batch processing, media 	transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing, scientific modeling & machine learning, and dedicated gaming servers.

	-> EBS Volumes can be attached to only one EC2 Instance at a time, but EC2 Instances can have multiple EBS Volumes attached to them.
	-> EBS Volumes allows instances' data to persist even after their termination.

Amazon Instance Store:
	-> EC2 Instance Store has a better I/O performance, but data is lost if: the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated, or when the underlying disk drive 	   fails.

EBS Snapshots:
	-> EBS Snapshots are used to backup data on your EBS Volumes at a point in time.

High Avaibalbility:

Vertical Scaling:
	-> Vertical scaling means increasing the size of the instance. Changing from a t3a.medium to a t3a.2xlarge is an example of size increase.


Auto Scaling Group(ASG):
	-> An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) can automatically and quickly scale-in and scale-out to match the changing load on your applications and websites.
	-> Auto Scaling Groups can add or remove instances, but from the same type. They cannot change the EC2 Instances Types on the fly.
	-> Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) offers the capacity to scale-out and scale-in by adding or removing instances based on demand.

Application Laod Balance:
	-> Auto Scaling Groups can add or remove instances, but from the same type. They cannot change the EC2 Instances Types on the fly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMP Points:
	
Saving Plans for EC2:
	-> For the exam, there is no need to memorize these savings numbers. All you need to remember is that a 3 years term would always be more cost-	effective than a 1-year term. Then within a term, "all upfront" is better than "partial upfront" which in turn is better than "no upfront" from a cost 	savings perspective.


The following AWS services support reservations to optimize costs:
	-> Amazon EC2
	-> Amazon DynamoDB
	-> Amazon ElasticCache
	-> Amazon RDS
	-> Amazon RedShift

Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: 
	-> compute, storage, and outbound data transfer
	->  there is no charge for inbound data transfer or data transfer between other AWS services within the same region

-> The AWS account must be able to operate as a standalone account. Only then it can be removed from AWS organizations
	For each account that you want to make standalone, 
	-> you must accept the AWS Customer Agreement, 
	-> choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method
